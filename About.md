**📸 AWS-Powered Receipt Automation System**

Manual receipt handling is slow, error-prone, and hard to scale. This
project automates receipt processing using AWS services to extract,
store, and notify users---without human effort.

📂 From upload to notification, everything happens
automatically---turning receipt images or PDFs into structured, stored,
and shared data.

**💡 Why Automate Receipts?**

Perfect for businesses, colleges, and events. Benefits:

✅ Faster processing  
✅ Fewer errors  
✅ Scalable & secure  
✅ Instant notifications

**🏗️ System Architecture**

Each layer uses a specialized AWS service:

**🗂️ Storage**

**Amazon S3**  
→ Secure upload & storage of receipt files (images/PDFs)

**🔍 Text Extraction**

**Amazon Textract**  
→ AI OCR extracts key fields like date, amount, and vendor

**📊 Data Storage**

**Amazon DynamoDB**  
→ Saves structured data for fast, scalable access

**✉️ Notifications**

**Amazon SES**  
→ Sends auto-emails with receipt summaries

**🧠 Automation**

**AWS Lambda**  
→ Serverless function triggers on new uploads to kick off processing
